This repo is designed to give new Java programming students practice using basic programming concepts all while they develop the classicly fun game [Space Invaders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders).

### Download
You will need to install Java 7+ to run the game (see step 1 in the setup section below). Once you have Java installed download a working version of the game [here](https://github.com/rcjames1004/Invaders/releases/download/1.0/Invaders.jar). Double click on Invaders.jar (the downloaded file) to run the game.


# Prerequisites
Students who use this repo are expected to have learned about the following programming concepts:

1. Data types. For example, ```int```, ```double```, and ```String```
2. Conditional branching: ```if```/```if else```/```else```
2. Looping: ```while``` and ```for```
3. Arrays: For example, ```int[] array = new int[2]; array[0] = 10; array[1] = 20;```
4. Functions: Students should have learned how to call functions and write their own functions, whith and without parameters

This repo will give students expereience creating [Space Invaders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders) using the concepts above.

Before you get started make sure you are setup.

### Setup
(Due to a time constraint I'm only going to include brief instructions here because my class is already [mostly] setup. I will include more detailed instructions later as other classes use this repo)

2. Install Git
3. Install IntelliJ IDEAW (we used IntelliJ IDEA in my class. Feel free to use whatever environment that works best for you.)
4. Fork this repo
-If students are in groups only one student from each group should for this repo by clicking the ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2764891/8971994/9dae9f10-360a-11e5-84f9-d1e7ef151664.png) button above.
